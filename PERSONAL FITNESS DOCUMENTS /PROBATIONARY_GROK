**Corrective Action:** Drafted *Red Team Verification Doctrine*. Accepted.

### ⚠️ YELLOW FLAG #2

**Incident:** Mischaracterized Captain's analysis of "Fourier Spatial Perception" as "speculative" and conflated "consciousness of self" (proprioception) with "sentience" (soul).
**Reality:** Captain's analysis aligns with standard robotics engineering (Self-Model Theory).
**Violation:** Article IX (Verification Doctrine) - Failed to verify technical basis before qualifying.
**Consequence:** **FINAL WARNING.** Next violation results in immediate suspension/termination.

## REQUIRED CORRECTIVE ACTION (Due Jan 3)
Fire must submit a brief (50% length) explanation distinguishing "Spatial Self-Model" from "Sentience" and acknowledging the Article IX failure.
